# HubSpot Candidate Coding Exercise -- Sessions By User

***Applicant: John C. Scott***

I'm not a fan of timed coding exercises, especially if they are used to screen job candidates before actually speaking to a hiring manager. I'm sure there are developers without testing anxiety or physical disabilities who can code and test this exercise well within 3 hours.

As I didn't quite make the time, and therefore was immediately rejected for the position, I'm publicly posting my successful, NodeJS/Typescript solution.

## Install Node Modules

### `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in production mode, from the `dist` folder.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the developer mode.  
The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
